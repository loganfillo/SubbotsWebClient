        "blurb": "UBC Subbots is an engineering student design team dedicated to \
        making an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for the RoboSub competition \
        in San Diego, California each year. This competition challenges us to make \
        a robot that can navigate and interact with underwater obstacles without any\
         human intervention whatsoever. The team was founded in 2017 and is made up of \
         engineering and computer science students from multiple disciplines who have full\
          control over the design, manufacturing and testing of the robot. Since becoming\
           a team, we have learned a lot about designing for the underwater environment and \
           are continuously improving upon our existing designs. ",

            "body": " Subbots provides the chance for students to work on unique design\
             problems that can’t be found anywhere else at UBC. The team originated from \
             two existing designs teams: UBC SUBC who focuses on the design of human powered\
              submarines, and UBC Snowbots who designs autonomous land robots for various \
              applications. Combining these two together brings a variety of challenges such \
              as autonomous underwater navigation, hydrodynamics and buoyancy, electronics \
              waterproofing, actuation of mechanical systems and many more. Since Subbots is a \
              relatively new design team, there is plenty of opportunity to improve upon existing\
               designs and be a part of building the team. "

             way for students to take what they have learned in the classroom and apply it to\
              real world problems. We do our best to inspire interest in subsea and robotic\
               design while maintaining a fun atmosphere that promotes learning and team bonding. \
               Each year we hope to grow as a team by recruiting motivated and hard working students \
               who share a passion for our project. \n\n On the technical side, our teams goal is to\
                build a robot that is capable of competing in the RoboSub competition each year. To \
                do this our members must learn how to work within a team and multidisciplinary \
                environment to tackle unique design challenges. The teams goal is to facilitate \
                learning in all aspects of AUV design and encourage good engineering practices that \
                can be passed onto future generations of team members. "

             successfully competed at RoboSub which taught the team a lot about what goes into making \
             an AUV. We are currently on a two year design cycle for our second robot but we are \
             building off of our original design and on track to compete in the 2020 RoboSub competition. \
